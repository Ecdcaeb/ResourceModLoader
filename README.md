### What is ResourceModLoader

ResourceModLoader is a mod loader or not.

At first, in JE 1.13, data packs were added to Minecraft. Prior to this, the resource package already had some data package functions, such as using JSON to define a large number of recipes in more recipes, and mod authors could also use JSON to define their progress. However, the data package functions of these resource packages can only be used in modules and cannot be applied to real resource packages.

However, when we compat with `crt` and `kubejs`, it changed. More and more users use ResourceModLoader to pack their scripts. This is different from DataPack.Therefore, the current ResourceModLoader is not a pure LowCode.
