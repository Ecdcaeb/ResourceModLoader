# summary

ResourceModLoader is a module that allows loading non-executable Mods (`Resource Mod`), but can also be used as a library for modules written in Java.

In JE 1.13, data packs were added to Minecraft. 
Prior to this, the resource packs already had some data pack functions, such as using JSON to define a large number of recipes in more recipes, and mod authors could also use JSON to define their advancements.
However, the data package functions of these resource packages can only be used in mods and cannot be applied to real resource packs.

This module reads the `.zip` and `.jar` file or `directories` containing the `rml.info` file in `mods/`, packages it as a mod and runs it.

## Attention

ResourceModLoader is not a ModLoader and cannot load Mods instead of ModLoader.
